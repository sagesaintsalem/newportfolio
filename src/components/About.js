            <p>I'm Rita Toussaint and I'm a CodeClan graduate, a career changer, and a web developer! 
                    I have a flair for front-end but I also have skills to share in back-end development too! I spend a lot of my time sharpening my skills, attending networking events and workshops, keeping my LinkedIn page up to date and building my portfolio site (psst - youâ€™re already here!). Today, I am doing freelance work for English learning company, Intrepid English.</p>
                       
            <p>I know that this field will be a source of constant learning and I could not be more excited! Learning new things brings me such joy and inspires me. </p>
