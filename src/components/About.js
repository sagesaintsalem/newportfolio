            <p>I'm Rita Toussaint and I'm a CodeClan graduate, a career changer, and a web developer! 
                    I have discovered that I have a flair for front-end but I also have skills to share in back-end development too! On top of studying, I have been attending networking events and workshops whilst 
                    keeping my LinkedIn page up to date and building my portfolio site (psst - youâ€™re already here!). Today, I am doing freelance work for English learning company, Intrepid English.</p>
                   
                  
            <p>I know that this field will be a source of constant learning and I could not be more excited! Learning new things brings me such joy and inspires me. 
                    At my core, my biggest wish is to leave this world in a better place than I found it. I hope to use my new skills to improve lives, be that through designing a website or an app for a charity or through helping people protect their data. I sincerely hope that this site will be a springboard for me to achieve that.</p>
